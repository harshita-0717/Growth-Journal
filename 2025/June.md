# 📘 June 2025 - Daily Log

## 🗓️ June 12, 2025
- ✅ **What I Learned:**
    - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
    - SSRF Attack Techniques & Lab Exploitation
    - Unrestricted File Upload Vulnerabilities
    - Remote Code Execution via Web Shells
- 🔗 **Source:** PortSwigger Web Security Academy
     - Labs related to OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- 🕒 **Time Spent:** 2–3 hours
- 📝 **Notes:**
    - Validate MIME type and file content server-side
    - Store uploaded files outside web root
    - SSRF + File Upload often chained for deeper exploitation
    - Tools used: Burp Suite (Proxy, Repeater, Intruder)

  
## 🗓️ June 11, 2025
- ✅ **What I Learned:**
  - Explored **OSWP Top 10** (focus on **Authentication** & **Access Control flaws**)
  - Practiced **username enumeration** via response-based error analysis
  - Performed **password brute-force attacks** using Burp Suite & Python (`requests`)
  - Understood and identified **Horizontal vs Vertical Privilege Escalation**, and **Bypassing 2FA**
  - Set up and used **Burp Suite** for request interception, Intruder, and response analysis

     - Labs related to OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- 🕒 **Time Spent:** 2–3 hours
- 📝 **Notes:**
  - Authentication & access controls are often misconfigured — easy to exploit with wordlists
  - Response differences are key to enumeration
  - Burp + scripting = powerful combo for automating attacks


## 🗓️ June 10, 2025
- ✅ **What I Learned:** Started a new journey of OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities
     - Web application vulnerabilities like Path Traversal, Unprotected Admin Panels, JavaScript Info Disclosure, Insecure Cookie-based Role Control, and Horizontal Privilege Escalation using GUIDs.
     - How to identify and exploit these issues using browser, Burp Suite, and logic-based access tampering.
- 🔗 **Source:** PortSwigger Web Security Academy
     - Labs related to OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- 🕒 **Time Spent:** 3–4 hours
- 📝 **Notes:**
     - Path Traversal: Accessed server files using ../ in parameters
     - Admin Panel Exposure: Found hidden panels via robots.txt and JS
     - Cookie Role Escalation: Modified Admin=false to Admin=true using Burp response editor
     - Privilege Escalation (GUID): Accessed carlos's data by replacing my GUID with his in the URL
     - Importance of server-side access control and not trusting client inputs
